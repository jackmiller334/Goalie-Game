The object of the game is to save as many goals as you can.
The balls start slowly and gradually speed up the more goals you save in a row.

After saving a few goals in a row your 'combo' will increase, shown by the image on the
right hand side. 


Keyboard Controls:
Press 'space' to start the game.

Use LEFT and RIGHT keys to move the goalie.


Controller controls: ( Used an xbox 360 controller for this, Have not tested with 
other controllers )

Press 'A' to start the game.

Use the left stick to move left and right.

In the future I would like to add highscores and an actual home "screen" showing the 
title of the game.
